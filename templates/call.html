    <p>A female 911 operator answers your call and you have a hood swung over your head before you can say anything. What do you do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You struggle helplessly</li>
        <li>You punch the person in their extremities</li>
        <li>You hear a cat in the background as you're shoved in the car, and you knock yourself out on accident</li>
      </ul>
